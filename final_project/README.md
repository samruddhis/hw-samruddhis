# Final Project Repository

This repository contains the data needed for my final project. As of now, there are two folders:
- data: holds datasets 
- output: will holds future output files

# Data 

The data I am looking at was collected by The Marshall Project, a non-profit organization that looks at the United States criminal justice system. This data in particular looks at the infection rates of COVID-19 in prisons across the nation. The dataset I am looking at (covid_prison_cases.csv) contains weekly time series data on tests, infections and deaths in prisons. 

The primary variables I am looking at are:
- total staff cases
- total prisoner cases
- total staff deaths
- total prisoner deaths
