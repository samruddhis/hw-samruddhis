# What is a Repository?

A **repository** is a central location to store files (such as R scripts or R markdown Files).

### How do you Navigate a Repository?

Welcome to my repository! It is located on GitHub: a platform that specifically stores code.

There are currently two branches:
- the master branch
- the hw01 branch

This is where I practice & submit code for the course [Programming with Data](https://progdata.netlify.app/#about)!
