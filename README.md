# What is a Repository? :bulb:

A **repository** is a central location to store files (such as R scripts or R markdown Files).

## How do you Navigate my Repository? :thought_balloon:

Welcome to my repository! It is located on GitHub: a platform that specifically stores code.

There are currently two branches:
- the master branch
- the hw01 branch

This is where I practice & submit code for the course [Programming with Data](https://progdata.netlify.app/#about)!
